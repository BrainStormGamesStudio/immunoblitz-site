  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: May 29, 2025</p>

  <p>BrainStorm Games ("we", "us", or "our") developed the mobile game <strong>ImmunoBlitz</strong> as a free-to-play educational app designed for children aged 8–14. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>We do not knowingly collect any personal data from users, including children under 13. ImmunoBlitz does not require account creation for its core functionality, and no personally identifiable information (PII) is requested or stored by us.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Collected Automatically</h2>
  <p>We may use third-party services (such as Google AdMob) that automatically collect limited, anonymized data such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device type and operating system</li>
    <li>General location (country-level only)</li>
    <li>In-game actions for analytics (e.g. wave completions, scores)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data is collected solely to improve gameplay and display appropriate ads, in accordance with COPPA and GDPR-K regulations.</p>

  <h2>3. Ads and Monetization</h2>
  <p>ImmunoBlitz uses Google AdMob to show ads. These ads are subject to Google’s Families Policy and do not display personalized advertising to children. We do not serve behaviorally targeted ads to users under the age of 13.</p>

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>We take children's privacy seriously. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us immediately and we will take steps to remove that information.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
  <p>ImmunoBlitz may contain links to educational content or external leaderboards. These services do not require personal data and are optional.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We use commercially reasonable measures to protect user data and ensure secure communication between the app and our servers.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page and take effect immediately.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
